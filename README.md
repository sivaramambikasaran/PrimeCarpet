Prime Carpet
============

We define a prime carpet as follows: Consider functions ![ScreenShot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sivaramambikasaran/PrimeCarpet/master/PC1.png) and ![ScreenShot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sivaramambikasaran/PrimeCarpet/master/PC2.png). The prime carpet is obtained by plotting $g(n)$ versus $f(n)$ and coloring each lattice point $(x,y)$ based on the following criterion:

Color $1$: If $x$ and $y$ are both primes.

Color $2$: If $x$ is a prime and $y$ is not.

Color $3$: If $y$ is a prime and $x$ is not.
